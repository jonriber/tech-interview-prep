# Thinking in OOP mode

Step-by-step to think pragmatically in OOP mode.

## Understand core concepts

1. Class = A blueprint for creating objects
2. Object = An instance of a class
3. Encapsulation = Keep internal details hidden, exposing only what is necessary
4. Abstraction = Simplify complex reality by modeling classes appropriate to the problem
5. Inheritance = Reuse code by creating new classes from existing ones
6. Polymorphism = Use a unified interface for different data types or classes
