# Encapsulation - OOP

Encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of OOP.

The main idea behinf it is to bundledata (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class) 
and restricting direct access to some of the object's components.

In python, encapsulation is implemented by:

1. Using private and protected menbers (via naming convention)
2. Controlling access to data using getters and setters.
