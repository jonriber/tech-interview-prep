# Abstraction - OOP

Abstraction means hiding complext implementation details and showing only what is essential.

It allows me to:

- Work with `what` an object does instead of `how` it does it.
- Focus on `relevant behavior`, ignoring other mechanics


## Real life analogy

I am now creating a scenario of a car:

- While inside the car, I can use `steering whell, brake and accelerator`. This is interface.
- I donÂ´t really need to know how engine or transmission works in order to use car functionalities.

## Abstraction in Code

In programming languages, abstraction is commonly implemented using:

- Abstract classes
- Interfaces (protocols in python)
- Method hiding via public/protected/private modifiers
