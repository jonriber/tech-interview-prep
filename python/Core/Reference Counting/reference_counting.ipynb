    "# Reference Counting\n",
    "\n",
    "Managing reference counts of Python objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference counting is a core concept in Python's memory management system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to gain insights into how Python handles objects in memory, reclaims unused resources and avoids memory leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reference counting tracks the number of `variables or references` pointing to an object in memory.\n",
    "- When reference count for an object drops to zero, Python automatically frees memory occupied by that object, making it available for reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it works?\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "  my_var = 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what happens under the hood when one declares a variable in python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python creates an object of type `int` with the value 10 at a specific `memory address`\n",
    "- `my_var` becomes a reference (pointer) to that object.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, at this point, in our python application, the reference coint for the object 10 is 1, because only `my_var` references it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding references\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, adding another reference to the same object:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "  other_var = my_var\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what is happening:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `other_var` doesn't create a new object or copy the value of 10. Instead, it points to the same memory address as `my_var`\n",
    "- The reference count for the object 10 increases to 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Removing References\n",
    "\n",
    "When a reference is removed, the reference count decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "  my_var = None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `my_var` no longer points out to the object 10\n",
    "- The reference count for the object 10 drops back to 1, so, right now, only `other_var` points to the address of the object 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "  other_var = None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if we remove the reference to the object 10 that was being used in `other_var`, the reference counting of object 10 drops to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's memory manager frees up the memory occupied by the object 10."
